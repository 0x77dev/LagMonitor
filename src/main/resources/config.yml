# Check if a server (especially a plugin) is doing block I/O operations on the main Thread.
# Operations like SQL-, HTTP-Request or Scoket-Connections should be performed in a seperate Thread.

# * CPU MHZ
# * File reads/writes (per second or since startup)
# * Network download/upload (per second or since startup)
# * OS uptime
# * Linux/Unix load
# * Network adapter speed
# * RAM cache
# * CPU i/o wait percentage

# Then place the driver for your OS into the plugin folder where this config is located.
# You can find the drivers in the zip file in the folder "hyperic-sigar-1.6.4/sigar-bin/lib"
#
# If you don't know which driver you need, you can invoke /env or activate this option and
# invoke /hardware - This plugin will show which driver it exactly want.
